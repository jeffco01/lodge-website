      <h2>What is the basic goal of Freemasonry?</h2>

      <p>
        Through the improvement and strengthening of the character of the individual man,
        Freemasonry seeks to improve the community. Thus, it impresses upon its members
        the principle of personal righteousness and personal responsibility, enlightens them
        as to those things which make our human welfare and inspires them with that feeling
        of charity, or good will, toward all mankind which will move them to translate
        principle and conviction onto action.
      </p>

      <p>
        Freemasonry also seeks to enlighten the mind, promote peace and understanding --
        and whatever may enhance and adorn man's contact with man -- and to stimulate the
        noble and generous impulses of the human heart to practice its basic tenets of
        Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.
      </p>

      <p>
        The fraternity stands firmly on the bedrock foundation of Brotherhood -- universal
        Brotherhood -- and all that is implied by that noble word.
